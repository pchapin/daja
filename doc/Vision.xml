  <title>Daja Vision Statement</title>

  <para>In this section we outline the philosophy and long range goals of Daja. By doing so we
    put Daja in context and sketch an overall vision for the project. The vision is intended to
    guide the project's development and be the source of its requirements.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should be constructed in a modular fashion so that it can be effectively called
        as a library from other applications. Daja should support developers of D tools by
        exposing independent components, such as the parser and type checker, as well defined
        modules with clean, documented interfaces.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should support being used from modern IDEs using whatever means and protocols
        are appropriate to do so.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should support an extension architecture so that users can extend the compiler
        in useful ways in a well defined manner.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should be designed from the ground up to take advantage of modern hardware by
        using parallelism and distributed computing when appropriate.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should be a "compiler writer's compiler," optionally exposing various compiler
        internals that might of interest to the power user.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should attempt to be compatible enough with dmd so that one could easily port a
        dmd project to Daja. On the other hand Daja shouldn't be slavishly compatible with dmd
        and should develop its own approach to doing things where appropriate.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Daja should attempt to integrate the D, Scala, and Java communities. It should, to
        the greatest extent possible, follow the best practices of all these communities and
        attempt to create a "comfortable common ground" for potential contributors from these
        communities.</para>
