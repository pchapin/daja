Run Time System
===============

This folder contains the Daja run time system. It is divided into two parts: the run time
support library in the RL folder, and the standard library in the SL folder. The support library
contains components that are needed to faithfully implement D semantics and that are not
directly used by programmers. This includes exception handling support, dynamic memory support,
constraint checking, and so forth. The standard library contains the components used by
programmers.
